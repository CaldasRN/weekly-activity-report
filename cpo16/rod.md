#### GitHub

I got hands-on experience in creating new GitHub repositories(repos), cloning existing repos and learned how to interact with GitHub in a group environment with multiple contributors.  I was able to generate documentation in the from of README.md files to describe projects and reviewed existing README.md files to add portions according to my contribution.  I was taught the SOFWERX standard for Forking repos to create my version and the process of submitting Pull Requests to have my changes incorporated in the main branch of a project.  I am comfortable going forward and using Git effectively as a collaboration tool to simplify the effort and track tasks as they get accomplished.

#### GLO

![GLO Globe](Glo.png)

GLO stands for Global Logistic Overview.  I was assigned as the project lead to develop a prototype web-app to simplify the way the DoD does logistics.  My tasks included:
  - Conducting meetings with Military personnel to refine the desired outcome.
  - Manage remote coders to meet time requirements.
  - Demonstrate Prototype:
      * At SOFIC
      * At SOCOM headquarters on MacDill AFB
      * At SOFWERX during tours and for possible contributors
      * To General Thomas directly.
