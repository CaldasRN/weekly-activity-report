#### GitHub Now

   I got hands-on experience in creating new GitHub repositories(repos), cloning existing repos and learned how to interact with GitHub in a group environment with multiple contributors.  I was able to generate documentation in the from of README.md files to describe projects and reviewed existing README.md files to add portions according to my contribution.  I was taught the SOFWERX standard for Forking repos to create my version and the process of submitting Pull Requests to have my changes incorporated in the main branch of a project.  I am comfortable going forward and using Git effectively as a collaboration tool to simplify the effort and track tasks as they get accomplished.

#### Geo Package

#### GLO

   GLO stands for Global Logistic Overview.  I was assigned as the project lead to develop a prototype web-app to simplify the way the DoD does logistics.  

   My tasks included:
  -  Conducting meetings with Military personnel to refine the desired outcome.
  -  Manage remote coders to meet time requirements.
  -  Demonstrate Prototype:
   * At [SOFIC](http://exhibits.ndia.org/sofic2018/Public/Enter.aspx)
   * At [USSOCOM](https://www.socom.mil/) headquarters on MacDill AFB
   * At [SOFWERX](https://www.sofwerx.org/) during tours and for possible contributors
   * To [General Thomas](https://dod.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography-View/Article/709270/general-raymond-a-thomas-iii/) (USSOCOM Commanding General) directly.

The prototype is online for interaction at [Glo Demo](http://glo-demo.vmhost.devwerx.org/)

#### EDGES

   EDGES will provide a second method of navigation in the event that GPS signals get blocked.  The system will run in the background of an android device gathering any RF signals in the area, sort them based on power and frequency and correlate it with positioning data from the GPS system.  During a conflict where the enemy employs a GPS signal blocker, the warfighter will have a functional positioning system for use as needed.

   My tasks included:
  -  Developing Data Structures so the project stored the required data in the appropriate format.
  -  Editing the sweep function to work correctly from an android environment.
  -  Testing the prototype.
