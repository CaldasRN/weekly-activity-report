 ### Big Three
 - Total budget decided for Battery Optimization Swap (BOS)
 - Decided to use ROS/C++
 - Regenerative vs wireless transfer of power
 
 ### Objective
 To design a power supply for a completely autonomous security rover. Monitoring and replacing power source is critical to functionality.
 
 ### Work I Did
 - Researched power supply methods:
    - Redundancy of second rover
    - Wireless power transfer using class E or A amplifier and a charging station
    - Regen braking as a means of onboard regenerative power for continuous operation
 - Sketched preliminary circuit elements for regen system
 - Practiced C++
 - Learned how to implement an insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) in simple accrued power circuits, used for solenoids or regen applications
 - Compared IGBT to metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET)
 - Looked at possible bill of materials
 
 ### Meetings
 (09/14/18) Met with Project Lead Juanita Graham, David Salvador, and Jacob Fletcher to discuss budget, estimated timeline, and software/hardware goals.
 (09/27/18) Discussed project objectives with Brigette Boody and Jacob Fletcher. Set goals for Brigette, i.e., learning C++ and becoming more familiar with SLAM and ROS.
 
 ### Summary
 This week was spent getting our bearings in the process, deciding which directions we might pursue in hardware and software.
 
 ### Follow-Up
 - Need to crash-course C++ to begin looking at autonomous vehicle software; tag-team autonomy problem with Fletcher
 - Will also need to simulate a regen power system, or wireless transfer to finalize bill of materials
 - Check with Brigette's flow-chart progress to address potential challenges the rover might face
