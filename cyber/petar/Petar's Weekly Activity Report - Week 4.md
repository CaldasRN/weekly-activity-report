### Big Three

- Tried running and initializing the RadioML repository through Jupyter Notebook and configured a dedicated laptop for those processes used by the repository. 

- Began looking into converting the RadioML Jupyter Notebook template from python 2 to python 3 for resolving GPU compatibility issues but encounter further complications.

- RF Classification project managment and team task assignment, organization and prioritization. 

### Objective

Develop or implement a technology which scans and classifies radio frequencies depending on the patterns and characteristics of the signal passed through them.

### Work I Did

Familirizing myself with the RadioML repository and all the required packages and components for it provided me with a better idea of how to set the needed environment for our project. By begining setup of the RadioML docker image on a dedicated laptop we will finally be able to begin creating and formatting new dataset. On the other hand, to be able to train the newly collected data we will need a proper algorithm and model. For that I began examining more efficient ways of incorporating the RadioML Jupyter Notebook template and setting the right packages up for different systems and language versions. This in turn would allow us to utilize the Minsky GPU instead of CPU or a different system with GPU capabilities. 

### Meetings
