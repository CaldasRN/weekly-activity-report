### Big Three

- Tensorflow successfully detecting most domecameras shown

- Python code taking GPS cords and downloading relative google streetview images

- Mass coordinates of citys now obtained from extract.bbbike.org


### Intent

The intent behind my project is to download every single street view image in a given city. After these are downloaded, object recognition will take place and identify stuff like power transformers, security cameras etc. The purpose is to be able to quickly and automatically map out an entire cities power grid or security camera locations


### Meetings
 - Weekly Friday Review meeting with David
 - Weekly Friday meeting with team

### Follow up

- Clean up coordinates obtained from extract.bbbike.org
- Collect more images of domecameras, longcameras, power transformers
- Move docker file to cluster
