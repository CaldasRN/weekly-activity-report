- Researched and identify RF Signal classification algorithms, papers and methods.

- Identify methods for generating datasets and examine overall data from implemented classification methods.

- Review possible methods for varying developed classification methods

### Objective

Develop or implement a technology which scans and classifies radio frequencies depending on the patterns and characteristics of the signal passed through them.

### Work I Did

Reviewed variety of sources concerning the main objective. Analized implementation methods for all potential solutions found and their significant toward defining the overall goal. Begin brainstorming of potential data collection methods and pattern identification techniques.
